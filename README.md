## Deployment

  1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/azim094

  2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url;  https://github.com/azim094/milestoneproject1

  3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it.  Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://azim094.github.io/milestoneproject1/

  4.  To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/azim094/milestoneproject1   and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/azim094/milestoneproject1.git      Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
