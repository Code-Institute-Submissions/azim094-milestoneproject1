            Not everyone perceives a healthy lifestyle in exactly the same way,
            but most would agree that it consists of eating the right things and
            regularly taking part in a form of physical activity. We've got
            recipes, exercise tips and a tonne of other expert resources to help
            you stay healthy, whatever that means to you.

          Joint pain isn't an inevitable part of ageing. While genetics can play
          a part in whether you'll experience joint deterioration, your
          lifestyle can have a huge effect on maintaining joint health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling full The heavier you are, the more load your joints bear and
          the faster they will wear out. Even small changes can have an impact -
          losing just one stone will take around seven stone off your knee joint
          with every step. Exercise, but take it easy Gentle exercise and
          stretches focused on your hips and knees can make a big difference to
          your ability to avoid and recover from injury and reduce wear and tear
          on the joints. Eat healthy Making good food choices Antioxidants are
          thought to slow the progression of arthritis inflammation, Vitamin E
          has anti-inflammatory properties and Omega-3 has been linked to
          reduced joint pain and stiffness.
